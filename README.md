# static_site_generator
The complete static_site_generator project from Boot.dev
There would be a folder in root named images that provides images for whatever html file is produced using the md files in content.
I wish that during the project there would've been some encouragement to push changes to github and stuff. Maybe that will come at a later date or with Primeagen's git course.
